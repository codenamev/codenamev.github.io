  <p>
    I code up a storm of bits at <a href="http://www.reenhanced.com" title="Reenhanced">Reenhanced</a>.
    Testing has become my obsession, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile software development</a>
    has become a voluminous molten core of my coding habits.
    When I'm not elegantly performing the stormy magic of the sky with fully automated tests at work,
    I hack away on <a href="https://github.com/codenamev">open source</a>,
    marvel at the <a href="http://under30ceo.com/top-25-ted-talks-you-must-watch-amazing-inspiring-and-unique/">wonderful future</a>
    we are all in for, and learn new things.
